## Byzantine Generals Problem
In distributed systems, there is often a problem of determining what the general agreement is among Nodes of the system. It is possible that some nodes may fail or be faulty but the group of nodes that are not faulty should agree upon a decision. This is known as a consensus algorithm and is fundamental to distributed systems that are leaderless. The idea of the algorithm is that depending on how many faulty nodes we have within our distributed system, we will need to send messages that many times to ensure that the faulty messages do not cause a faulty decision. For the remainder of this README, general and node are synonyms. 

This algorithm guarantees that the generals will come to an agreement on the correct decision. There is one exception to this algorithm and that is when the commander(or first general) is one of the faulty generals. In this case, the node will send faulty messages to half of the nodes because it chooses faulty messages based off the id of the node it is sending too.
